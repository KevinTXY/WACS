WACS is a large suite of tools that each offer different solutions to various web accessibility issues. These include the following:

Gif-Stop - This module reduces the risk of web browsing for users with epilepsy by interrupting potentially dangerous animations. It pauses gifv files so that the user can view it when they are ready. This can help aid epilepsy as well as ADD/ADHD

Color Blindness Adjustments - Helps users with deuteranopia by raising the contrast of red colors, making it easier to distinguish between colors.

Caption Writer - Runs images on a page through a Vision API to determine the contents of the image, and then captions the image using that explanation by adding alt-text. Can be used by screen readers to help blind users browse even when web developers don't add their own alt-text.

Sensitivity Filter - Takes in an input from a user and blurs out or removes content related to that input, targeting users with PTSD to create a safer browsing experience.
Each feature can be individually enabled or disabled on a stylishly designed options page.
